# SNHU-CS-CAPSTONE
SNHU Capstone Portfolio for **Troy Smith CS-499**
There are four Milestones related to my final project for the SNHU computer science capstone.

There are three programs within the repository displaying my different computer science skills and abilities.
1. Software Design and Engineering - Transform a project into another coding language
2. Algorithms and Data Structure - Improve Efficiency 
3. Databases - Create a MongoDB using a RESTful API

## Milestone Two
  The Artifact chosen to display my work and skills learned in Software Engineering and Design is the Authentication program written in Java code and created in my IT 145 course on April 22, 2018.  This program uses the MD5 hash method to authenticate users into the Zoo Authentication System allowing them three chances before stopping any further attempts.  Once successful authentication is achieved, the user is greeted with a message according to their role in the Zoo system, which are admin, veterinarian, zookeeper or coder.  

  Inclusion of this artifact in my portfolio demonstrates my ability write code in the Java language to solve problems, in this case a means to authenticate users into a specific system.  It also demonstrates an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals by proving my worth as a computer scientist that has the skills to code in Java and then transform that language into Python for the enhancement portion of the project.  I have the skills to develop the code in a readable and transformable format that may be built upon for further enhancement alone, by someone else or within a team and possess the traits of a promising new computer scientist.

  I have enhanced the program by writing it in the Python language and condensing it into less lines of code in one file instead of multiple files with more lines of code.  The original code also required the program to completely exit or stop before another user could authenticate.  The enhanced Python code allows the program to continue to run and allow another user to authenticate into the system.  

  Python was the language used in my first introduction to coding in my CS 200 course in 2017 and has continued to intrigue me as an easy to read language that is versatile enough to be used in many different problem solving situations.  Although still new to coding and learning more each time I code, I find Python to be a very legible and straight forward language.  

  The original code had to be updated when files were moved or ran on other systems with a different file directory.  Often errors occurred when the file could not be found.  I learned this was not the case with the enhanced version and the Python code – the files opened flawlessly and less lines of code meant less work.  The enhanced version does include the usernames within the code presenting somewhat of a security risk, but the passwords are kept hidden with the MD5 hash method.  The original code kept the usernames and passwords in a separate credentials file that could be hidden or protected for security purposes.  The argument could be made to keep the entire code hidden for both the Java and Python code in that regard.

  Most of the challenge in enhancing the code was recalling the nuances of the Python language that I hadn’t used in quite a while.  Having a full time career while obtaining my Bachelor’s degree has resulted in taking one course at a time over the span of five years.  That leaves gaps in the last time I coded or used certain skills.  Thankfully reviewing my notes and visiting site on the web and watching videos brought back enough remembrance to get me through the challenge.
